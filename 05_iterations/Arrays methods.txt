# JavaScript provides a rich set of methods for working with arrays. Here's a breakdown of some commonly used methods:

1. Iteration Methods:

* forEach() - Executes a provided function once for each element in the array.
* map() - Creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the original array.
* filter() - Creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.

2. Transformation Methods:

* reduce() - Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.
* reduceRight() - Similar to reduce, but applies the function from right to left.
* sort() - Sorts the array in place (or returns a new sorted array) according to a comparison function.

3. Combination Methods:

* concat() - Merges multiple arrays into a single new array.
* slice() - Extracts a section of an array and returns a new array.

4. Element Access and Removal:

* indexOf() - Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it's not found.
* lastIndexOf() - Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it's not found.
* find() - Returns the value of the first element that passes a test implemented by the provided function.
* findIndex() - Returns the index of the first element that passes a test implemented by the provided function.
* pop() - Removes the last element from the array and returns it.
* push() - Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.
* shift() - Removes the first element from the array and returns it.
* unshift() - Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length.

5. Other Useful Methods:

* join() - Joins all elements of an array into a string, separated by a specified separator.
* fill() - Fills all or part of an array with a static value.
* includes() - Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries.
* isArray() - Determines whether an object is an array.
* reverse() - Reverses the order of the elements in place.
* copyWithin() - Copies part of an array to another part of the array within the same array.
